# cmdstack

🚀 **cmdstack** — One place for all your essential development commands.

---

## 💡 About

**cmdstack** was built to solve a common developer pain:  
> Basic and important commands for various development platforms (like Git, Docker, Node.js, Python, etc.) are scattered across their own documentation or websites — making it frustrating to switch between docs and platforms.

With **cmdstack**, you get a **single platform** where you can find, search, and organize all critical development commands in one place — saving you time and keeping your workflow smooth.
